title: Develop Custom Extension OpenAPI Spec
custom_edit_url: null
---

We've identified the following use cases based on the collaboration with IBM Consulting and the platform that they are building. We propose implementing a conversational AI solution using watsonx orchestrate that integrates with Oracle ERP on the following high-value journeys:

- Account Balance Inquiry
- Journal Batch Status Check
- Accounting Period Status
- Ledger Information Retrieval

For each journey, we identified the API Endpoint that we need and also developed user interaction flow. Below are examples of how we develop a custom extension OpenAPI spec so that users could interact with the endpoints through watsonx Assistant actions.

### Account Balance Inquiry Journey

- API Endpoint: GET `/fscmRestApi/resources/11.13.18.05/ledgerBalances`
- Develop an action model to recognize account, currency, and ledger queries
- Create OpenAPI wrapper to handle the observable parameters given in the IBMC endpoints: accountGroupName, accountName, accountingPeriod, currency, ledgerName
- Design a conversational flow to collect missing parameters if not provided in initial query


::: {.callout-note}
Example interaction:

- **User**: "What's the current balance for our Hardware account?"
- **Bot**: "Certainly! Which currency and ledger would you like to check?"
- **User**: "USD in the UK Primary Ledger."
- **Bot**: [Calls API with parameters] "The current balance for the Hardware account is $X,XXX,XXX.XX as of [CurrentAccountingPeriod]."
:::
**For OpenAPI spec example**, please see sections starting line 15 from [this example file](../../assets/openapi_example.json) where the **/ledgerBalances** route was developed

### Journal Batch Status Check Journey
- API Endpoint: GET `/fscmRestApi/resources/11.13.18.05/journalBatches`
- Develop an action model to recognize journal batch queries
- Create API wrapper to retrieve all journal batches
- Implement logic to filter and sort batches based on recency or other criteria
- Design conversation flow to offer details on specific batches

::: {.callout-note}

Example interaction: 

- **User**: "Show me the latest journal batches."
- **Bot**: [Calls API and processes response] 
    - "Here are the latest journal batches:
    - Batch ID: 12345, Description: 'Monthly Accruals', Status: Posted
    - Batch ID: 12346, Description: 'Expense Reimbursements', Status: Unposted. [...] 
    - Would you like more details on any specific batch?"
:::
**For OpenAPI spec example**, please see sections starting line 703 from [this example file](../../assets/openapi_example.json) where the **/journalBatches** route was developed

### Accounting Period Status
- API Endpoint: GET `/fscmRestApi/resources/latest/accountingPeriodStatusLOV`
- Develop an action model to recognize period and ledger queries (wxo)
- Create OAPI wrapper to handle parameters: ApplicationId, LedgerId, PeriodNameId
- Implement logic to translate user-friendly period names (i.e "June 2024") to system IDs
- Design conversation flow to collect ledger information if not provided

::: {.callout-note}

Example interaction:
- **User**: "What's the status of the June 2024 accounting period?"
- **Bot**: "Which ledger would you like me to check?"
- **User**: "The AU Council Primary Ledger."
- **Bot**: [Calls API with parameters] "The status of the June 2024 (06-24) period for the AU Council Primary Ledger is: Open."
:::
**For OpenAPI spec example**, please see sections starting line 1763 from [this example file](../../assets/openapi_example.json) where the **/journalBatches** route was developed

### Ledger Information Retrieval

- API Endpoint: GET `/fscmRestApi/resources/latest/ledgersLOV`
- Develop an actions and/or skills based model to recognize ledger information queries
- Create API wrapper to retrieve all ledgers or filter by name
- Implement logic to present ledger information in a concise, user-friendly format
- Design a conversation flow to offer additional details on specific ledgers

::: {.callout-note}

Example interaction:
- User: "What ledgers do we have in our system?"
- Bot: [Calls API and processes response] 
    - "Here are the primary ledgers in our system:
        - UK Primary Ledger
        - US Primary Ledger
        - Australian Primary Ledger
    - Would you like more details about any of these ledgers?"
