    "text": "We’ve identified the following use cases based on the collaboration with IBM Consulting and the platform that they are building. We propose implementing a conversational AI solution using watsonx orchestrate that integrates with Oracle ERP on the following high-value journeys:\n\nAccount Balance Inquiry\nJournal Batch Status Check\nAccounting Period Status\nLedger Information Retrieval\n\nFor each journey, we identified the API Endpoint that we need and also developed user interaction flow. Below are examples of how we develop a custom extension OpenAPI spec so that users could interact with the endpoints through watsonx Assistant actions.\n\nAccount Balance Inquiry Journey\n\nAPI Endpoint: GET /fscmRestApi/resources/11.13.18.05/ledgerBalances\nDevelop an action model to recognize account, currency, and ledger queries\nCreate OpenAPI wrapper to handle the observable parameters given in the IBMC endpoints: accountGroupName, accountName, accountingPeriod, currency, ledgerName\nDesign a conversational flow to collect missing parameters if not provided in initial query\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExample interaction:\n\nUser: “What’s the current balance for our Hardware account?”\nBot: “Certainly! Which currency and ledger would you like to check?”\nUser: “USD in the UK Primary Ledger.”\nBot: [Calls API with parameters] “The current balance for the Hardware account is $X,XXX,XXX.XX as of [CurrentAccountingPeriod].”\n\n\n\nFor OpenAPI spec example, please see sections starting line 15 from this example file where the /ledgerBalances route was developed\n\n\n\nJournal Batch Status Check Journey\n\nAPI Endpoint: GET /fscmRestApi/resources/11.13.18.05/journalBatches\nDevelop an action model to recognize journal batch queries\nCreate API wrapper to retrieve all journal batches\nImplement logic to filter and sort batches based on recency or other criteria\nDesign conversation flow to offer details on specific batches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExample interaction:\n\nUser: “Show me the latest journal batches.”\nBot: [Calls API and processes response]\n\n“Here are the latest journal batches:\nBatch ID: 12345, Description: ‘Monthly Accruals’, Status: Posted\nBatch ID: 12346, Description: ‘Expense Reimbursements’, Status: Unposted. […]\nWould you like more details on any specific batch?”\n\n\n\n\nFor OpenAPI spec example, please see sections starting line 703 from this example file where the /journalBatches route was developed \n\n\nAccounting Period Status\n\nAPI Endpoint: GET /fscmRestApi/resources/latest/accountingPeriodStatusLOV\nDevelop an action model to recognize period and ledger queries (wxo)\nCreate OAPI wrapper to handle parameters: ApplicationId, LedgerId, PeriodNameId\nImplement logic to translate user-friendly period names (i.e “June 2024”) to system IDs\nDesign conversation flow to collect ledger information if not provided\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExample interaction: - User: “What’s the status of the June 2024 accounting period?” - Bot: “Which ledger would you like me to check?” - User: “The AU Council Primary Ledger.” - Bot: [Calls API with parameters] “The status of the June 2024 (06-24) period for the AU Council Primary Ledger is: Open.”\n\n\nFor OpenAPI spec example, please see sections starting line 1763 from this example file where the /journalBatches route was developed \n\n\nLedger Information Retrieval\n\nAPI Endpoint: GET /fscmRestApi/resources/latest/ledgersLOV\nDevelop an actions and/or skills based model to recognize ledger information queries\nCreate API wrapper to retrieve all ledgers or filter by name\nImplement logic to present ledger information in a concise, user-friendly format\nDesign a conversation flow to offer additional details on specific ledgers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExample interaction: - User: “What ledgers do we have in our system?” - Bot: [Calls API and processes response] - “Here are the primary ledgers in our system: - UK Primary Ledger - US Primary Ledger - Australian Primary Ledger - Would you like more details about any of these ledgers?”\n\n\nFor OpenAPI spec example, please see sections starting line 1256 from this example file where the /journalBatches route was developed",

However, for RAG use cases, the data can be scattered and fragmented, making it challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) to process effectively.\nTo address this limitation, we developed a custom data pipeline that transforms all columns of data into a single paragraph of information. This pipeline enables the creation of a cohesive and structured input for LLMs, facilitating more accurate and reliable processing of RAG-related data.",

    "text": "Examples\nTo help in understanding the Oracle Cloud API, here are a few examples of how to call some of the key endpoints.\n\nExample: Get Account Balances\nTo get all account balances, you will need to provide query parameters such as accountGroupName, AccountName, accountingPeriod, and ledgerName.\nYou should provide query parameters and format the link as follows:\nhttps://&lt;url&gt;/fscmRestApi/resources/11.13.18.05/ledgerBalances?onlyData=true&finder=AccountGroupBalanceFinder;accountGroupName=%22%3cACCOUNT_GROUP_NAME%3e%22,accountName=%22%3cACCOUNT_NAME%3e%22,accountingPeriod=Jan-16,currency=%22%3cCURRENCY%3e%22,ledgerName=%22%3cLEDGER_NAME%3e%22&fields=AccountGroupName,AccountName,LedgerName,Currency,CurrentAccountingPeriod,AccountCombination,CurrentPeriodBalance,AmountType\nA curl command example of this:\ncurl -i -u \"&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;\" -H \"Content-Type: application/vnd.oracle.adf.resourcecollection+json\" -X GET https://servername.fa.us2.oraclecloud.com/fscmRestApi/resources/11.13.18.05/ledgerBalances?onlyData=true&finder=AccountGroupBalanceFinder;accountGroupName=Unallocated,accountName=Building Rent,accountingPeriod=Jan-16,currency=USD,ledgerName=Vision Foods - USA Ledger&fields=AccountGroupName,AccountName,LedgerName,Currency,CurrentAccountingPeriod,AccountCombination,CurrentPeriodBalance,AmountType\nYou can find additional information here.\n\n\n\nExample: Get Journal Batches\nWhile some API calls require specific query parameters, there are other use cases where a simple GET request to the endpoint retrieves the necessary information. An example of that is get journal batches.\nSimple GET request to the following link: https://&lt;url&gt;/fscmRestApi/resources/11.13.18.05/journalBatches\nA curl command example of this:\ncurl -i -u \"&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;\" -H \"Content-Type: application/vnd.oracle.adf.resourcecollection+json\" -X GET https://servername.fa.us2.oraclecloud.com/fscmRestApi/resources/11.13.18.05/journalBatches\nYou can find additional information here.\n\nUnderstanding the JSON format is crucial for extracting the correct data to display on the virtual assistant frontend.\nWith this understanding, a custom OpenAPI specification has been developed to integrate this seamlessly into our virtual assistant to avoid manually calling the endpoint each time.\n\n\nNotes on ERP Integration\nWhile the AskFinance project is designed to integrate with Oracle Cloud API, it’s worth noting that SAP can also be used as an alternative integration option. SAP is a widely used enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that can provide a rich source of financial data for analysis.\nKey Considerations for SAP Integration\n\nSAP API: SAP provides a range of APIs that can be used to integrate with AskFinance, including the SAP Cloud Platform API and the SAP S/4HANA API.\n\nAPIs in Finance\nAPIs for General Ledger Accounting\nAPIs for Financial Planning and Analysis\n\nData Mapping: When integrating with SAP, it’s essential to map the SAP data fields to the corresponding fields in AskFinance to ensure seamless data exchange.",
